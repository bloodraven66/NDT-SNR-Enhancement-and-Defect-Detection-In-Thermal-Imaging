# Final year project RITB
codebase for our final year project - " Signal processing approaches for noise reduction in pulsed thermography"

We worked on thermal images of stainless steel material with defects. We had two datasets, on with 250 images and the other with 200. These images are captured at time gaps of 0.008s. 

SNR improvement has been performed using convolutional autoencoders. Defect detection and localisation has been performed using LSTMs. ~ more documentation
