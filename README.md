extension of our final year project - " Signal processing approaches for noise reduction in pulsed thermography"
### Objectives:
1. Improve SNR in thermal images:<br>
  - Use autoencoders to increase image SNR. <br>
  - Obatined ~20+ SNR(db) increase over other signal processing techniques. <br>

  - Some of the reconstructed images are show above. 
2. Obtain better defect detection/visibility:<br>
  - Using LSTM to visualize defects and identify depth one-shot in a test dataset. Preliminary results:
  ![](images/lstm.png)
  - different colours correspond to different depths in the images.
